WIP WebRTC-NAT-Traversal-Proxy-Server using https://github.com/sinclairzx81/smoke/. Does not yet actually work outside of local network. 

The server runs as a web page in your browser and forwards all requests to localhost:8080 where your real server should be running

To install, clone this repo, and run `npm install` followed by `npm start` and vist `http://localhost:5000`
